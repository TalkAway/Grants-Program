## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

It's our first application.


### Overview

Talk Away is a social impact language learning startup that offers a unique and immersive learning experience. Our innovative approach involves learning languages through walking and exploring the city, making language learning both fun and practical.

 As a teaching platform on the web3, we are building a dapp and a metaverse prototype to further expand access to language learning. We haven't chosen a location to deploy yet, we would like to use Polkadot's decentralized metaverse infrastructure. Like efinity or other parachain metaverses projects.

 Our mission is to provide a differentiated teaching approach to promote language knowledge for people with limited financial resources and migratory vulnerability. We also aim to connect people from all over the world, fostering greater awareness of global cultural diversity.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
 In this moment we have a Proof of Concept with around 100 classes offered. Our next step is a MVP in web3.
 Our dApp will build from scratch under Polkadot.

 Dapp Solid overview:
 -	The home page contains classes and tutor info. 
 -	Forms for creating a user/tutor. 
 -	Log in with the user’s wallet.
 -	The user profile contains info about the user. Attended class, level, certifications
 -	The tutor profile contains info about the tutor, classes, rating 
 -	Terms policy
 -	Contact us
 
  Small enums 
 User type: student-tutor 
 Level enum: determine the level the student has 
 Student type enum: free - with certificate 

 Student info will be saved on the contract: 
 -	User id 
 -	User name 
 -	User type
 -	Public key 
 -	Level 
 -	Certificate 
 -	Has payed 
 -	Has checked 

 Tutor info will be saved on the contract: 
 -	User id 
 -	User name 
 -	Rating 
 -	Course info hash will contain a hash to the saved class info and material if existing.
 Course material and info will be saved on IPFS 

 Certification will be SBTs and will be minted at the end of each level.

 Technical parts: The stack will be React.js, node.js, and mongoose. 




Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Ecosystem Fit

By integrating Talkaway's language learning platform with Polkadot, the protocol could potentially access language learning data and insights, which could be used to enhance language learning outcomes and help individuals and organizations to better understand language acquisition.

 Through our work and the experience of our teachers, polkadot will learn more directly about the needs and behaviors of people who want to learn a new language within the ecosystem. For example: which language is most in demand on web3? Here in Brazil and elsewhere, people have a language barrier with English to deepen their knowledge and practices on web3 because of the lack of English. With the implementation of our MVP, Talk Away will provide this information to the blockchain ecosystem. Only 3% of people in Brazil speak this language.

 Polkadot will provide the blockchain infrastructure that will enable the creation of the dapp, this data and insights will come from our operation through the success of customers in our ecosystem.

 This could lead to the creation of new data-driven solutions and services that leverage insights from Talkaway's language learning platform and Polkadot Ecossystem

 Additionally, Talk Away's focus on promoting language knowledge for people with limited financial resources and migratory vulnerability could align with Polkadot Protocol's mission to democratize access to data and empower underrepresented groups. Overall, integrating Talkaway with blockchain could create new opportunities for data-driven innovation in language learning and support the broader mission of democratizing data access.

 Building a language hub has great potential for onboarding people from the web2 to the web3 universe, and so one can see how decentralized technology is useful in education.

 Polkadot will be fundamental to build the basic structure of the platform with advanced technology, and from there we will be able to scale our project. As a decentralized data exchange protocol, Polkadot provides a secure and decentralized way to share, monetize, and analyze data.
